完全是胡说八道

his song was part of the daily routine for many primary schools. It would be sung, following ["The Internationale"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale_in_Chinese) and ["The East is Red"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_East_is_Red_%28song%29).

The first two lines of this song were used as background music in the 1995 Japanese [Super Famicom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Famicom) [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game), [Hong Kong 97](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_97_%28video_game%29). The game, whose plot involved the [transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_sovereignty_over_Hong_Kong) in 1997, had a strong [anti-Communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism) China sentiment and the song was used as a parody.
